# Node

The Fluence protocol is implemented as the Fluence [reference node](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluence) which includes the

* Peer-to-peer communication layer
* Marine interpreter
* Aqua VM
* Builtin services

and more.

Builtin services are available on every Fluence peer and can be programmatically accessed and composed using Aqua. For a complete list of builtin services see the builtin.aqua file in the [Aqua Lib](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua-lib) repo. How to create your own builtin service, see the [Add Your Own Builtins](tutorials_tutorials/add-your-own-builtin.md) tutorial.
